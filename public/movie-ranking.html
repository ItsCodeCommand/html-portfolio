<h1>The Best Movies According to SPC Terrery </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>This movie has been my favorite since I was a kid. It's a basketball movie, which is my favorite sport.</p>
<h3>Rush Hour 3</h3>
<p>I can easily say that the Rush Hour triology is legendary, but the best one is Rush Hour 3. It's HILLARIOUS. Plus it has my favorite actors Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in it.</p>
<h3>Love & Basketball</h3>
<p>Im not a sucker for romance, but this movie definetly hits home. It's about a couple who grew up together fighting, playing ball, and having professional hoop dreams.</p>
